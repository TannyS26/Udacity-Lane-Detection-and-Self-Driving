    "#### OpenCV :\n",
    "    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### numpy :\n",
    "    NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### math :    \n",
    "    This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. These functions cannot be used with complex numbers, we can use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### sys :\n",
    "    The sys module provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### matplotlib :\n",
    "    Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. We can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### moviepy :\n",
    "    MoviePy is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing (a.k.a. non-linear editing), video processing, and creation of custom effects.MoviePy can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### IPython :\n",
    "    IPython provides a rich toolkit to help us make the most out of using Python interactively. Its main components are:\n",
    "            1. A powerful interactive Python shell\n",
    "            2. A Jupyter kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter notebooks and other interactive frontends."
